Merge concept flow:
1.First create one Repo in git hub.Then clone that repo code in local.
2.create one python file(feature-a.py)-->git add feature-a.py
3.then git commit 
4.git push to main
5.again add 2nd file and follow same process.Now we have 2 files in main branch.
6.create new feature branch and add file to it (feature-c-subbranch.py)
7.do git add,commit,push to subbranch.
8.do the same process to create 2nd file in sub branch or feature branch.
9.create PR and merge the changes to main branch.
10.now able to see commit flow like feature-a(main)-b(main)-c(featurebranch)-d(featurebranch)-merge commit.
